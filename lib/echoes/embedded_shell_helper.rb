# Per-pane subprocess that owns the pty as its controlling tty and
# runs Rubish::REPL on behalf of the parent Echoes process. By living
# in its own session and claiming the slave as ctty (TIOCSCTTY),
# every child rubish forks for an external command inherits the
# session/ctty — so ETX (Ctrl-C) the parent writes to the master
# becomes a SIGINT delivered by the line discipline to the foreground
# process group. Loops/pipelines now work because the session leader
# (this helper) stays alive across multiple forks.
#
# Communication with the parent:
#   - stdin  / stdout / stderr (fds 0/1/2) = pty slave (= controlling tty).
#       Rubish writes its prompts and command output to fd 1; children
#       read from fd 0.
#   - fd 3 = control_in: JSON-line messages from the parent.
#   - fd 4 = control_out: JSON-line responses + async events to parent.
#
# Wire format: one JSON object per line. Requests carry a string id;
# responses echo it. Async events have no id and use a "event" key.
